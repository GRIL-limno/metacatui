Rename a File       
=============

Scenario
--------

    As a scientist, I want to rename a file to a more appropriate name so I can easily keep my files organized.
    
Summary
-------
A scientist should be able to rename a file, including data files and metadata files (folder names).  The display should immediately show the new name, and they should be asychronously changed in the repository. The science metadata and containing package should be updated to reflect the change.
