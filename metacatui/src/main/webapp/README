MetacatUI Themes
-----------------
The "default" theme is included in the 'themes/' directory and provides all the 
models, collections, views, routers, and templates required to run a default 
Metacat UI.

Additional themes (e.g., "knb") provide alternative resources for 
items that will override the default theme. Each theme is a subdirectory named to 
match the name of the theme and mimics the structure of the default theme.

To switch themes:
-Edit the top-level 'loader.js' file and specify the name of the theme to use.
That's it!

Required items for a theme:
	'themes/<theme>/config.js'
	'themes/<theme>/css/metacatui.css'
	'themes/<theme>/img/favicon-32.png'

About CSS:
Each theme uses a 'themes/<theme>/css/metacatui.css' file that is pulled in during the initial
application loading. A copy of the default can be used and modified as needed.

To override html templates (or any other resource, like a Model or View):
-Copy the resource into the same child location, but in the new theme subdirectory.
-Edit that resource as needed.
-Add an entry to the theme's config.js file specifying that new resource.

Example (using navbar):
-Copy 'themes/default/templates/navbar.html' to 'themes/<theme>/templates/navbar.html'
-Edit 'themes/<theme>/config.js' to include:
	'templates/navbar.html' : 'themes/' + theme + '/templates/navbar.html',
