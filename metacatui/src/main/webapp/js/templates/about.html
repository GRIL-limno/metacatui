          The Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity (KNB) is an international
          repository intended to facilitate ecological and environmental
          research on biocomplexity.

        <p>
          For scientists, the KNB is an efficient way to discover,
          access, interpret, integrate and analyze complex ecological
          data. The data originate from a highly-distributed set of field stations,
          laboratories, research sites, and individual researchers.  The 
          foundation of the KNB is the rich, detailed metadata provided by 
          researchers that collect data, which promotes both automated and
          manual integration of data into new projects.

            As a long-term repository, the KNB allows you to preserve your data
            for future generations of scientists, and to share your data with 
            your colleagues today.  With support for instantly assigning DOIs,
            your data sets can be referenced in any publication.  And as a 
            DataONE Member Node, your data will be securely replicated to other
            servers, maintaining all of the access controls you set, public or private.
