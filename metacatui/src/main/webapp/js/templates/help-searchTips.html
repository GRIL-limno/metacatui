<h2>Search Tips</h2>
<h3>General</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Searching for multiple words at the same time will look for matches with that exact phrase - 
	e.g. <code>marine mammal</code> will only return matches mentioning <code>marine mammal</code> - 
	<code>marine</code> and <code>mammal</code> will return results mentioning the individual words marine and mammal.</li>
	<li>Search filters are looking for matches in the science metadata for each data set. 
	Any text or metadata contained in the data files (e.g. .csv table, .zip folder) will not be searched.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Data Attribute</h3>
<p>Searches the attribute names (e.g. column headers) of data tables</p>
<h5>Examples</h5>: <code>salinity</code>, <code>lifestage</code>

<h3>Data files</h3>
<p>If this filter is checked, only search results that include data files will be returned. 
If it is unchecked, some search results may be metadata files only.</p>

<h3>Member Node</h3>
<p>Select one or more DataONE Member Nodes to exclude your search to only data from those Member Nodes. 
Each search result originated from only one Member Node, and its logo will be displayed in the search result listing.</p>

<h3>Creator</h3>
<p>Searches the person name(s) or entity (organization, group, etc.) name(s) that are listed as creators of a dataset. 
The username of the user who uploaded a data set is not taken into account (use the "Anything" filter instead).</p>
<h5>Examples:</h5> <code>Smith</code>, <code>John Smith</code>

<h3>Year</h3>
<p>You can filter results by year in two ways:</p>
<ul>
	<li><h5>Year(s) of data coverage</h5>: Year that data was collected</li>
	<li><h5>Year of publication</h5>: Year that data was published. If the data creator did not provide a publish date, then the year the data was uploaded is used instead.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Identifier</h3>
<p>An advanced filter to use when searching for a dataset by part or all of itâ€™s ID or DOI (Digital Object Identifier).
<a href="#about/assigning-dois">What is a DOI?</a></p>
<h5>Examples</h5>: <code>lter</code>, <code>doi:10.5063/F1HH6H0R</code>

<h3>Taxon</h3>
<p>Searches all taxonomic ranks that were provided by the data set creator for a full or partial match.</p> 
<h5>Examples</h5>: <code>Dreissena polymorpha</code>, <code>Mollusca</code>

<h3>Location</h3>
<p>Searches the geographic site or study area description. 
The location may be a place name or a detailed description of the study site.</p> 
<h5>Examples</h5>: <code>Hudson River</code>, <code>freshwater</code>
